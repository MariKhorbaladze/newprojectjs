Summary
When building your ecommerce website you’ll probably focus on great product imagery, detailed product listings, and a quality payment system. 

One thing that you might not pay much attention to is adding a blog to your website. But you should!

A blogging strategy is a great way of nurturing customer relationships, raising brand and product awareness, and generating inbound traffic to your ecommerce store. 

If you take the time to get it right, blogs can be extremely beneficial to your ecommerce business which is why we’ve put together this list of 10 of the best ecommerce blogs on the internet. 

Why Is a Blog Crucial for Your Ecommerce Website?
Blogs are a crucial part of the online strategy for any successful ecommerce business. But what is a blog, and why are they so important? 

They can direct visitors to your website who, once landed on your store, will navigate around and, with any luck, convert into customers. 

They’re also a great way of raising awareness about your brand and specific products that you want to showcase to potential customers. 

One of the key benefits of introducing a blogging strategy for your ecommerce store is that it can majorly improve your SEO results. 

Search engines such as Google love new, relevant, and quality content. 

If you’re able to regularly post blogs that are relevant to your niche, high-quality, and optimized for your target keywords, you’ll have a good chance of appearing in search results. 

As we all know, the better you rank in search engine results for your target search terms, the more relevant traffic you’re likely to direct to your website. The more traffic your website receives, the more people you have an opportunity to convert into customers. 

Blogging is a great way to insert relevant search terms into your website content without appearing spammy. Our top blogging tips include using keywords naturally in your copy, helping readers find ansers to their queries, and making your posts easy to read.

Luckily for you, all of the major ecommerce website builders such as Shopify, Wix, and Squarespace have a blog functionality available, which makes adding a blog to your ecommerce store quick and easy.

Aside from the products, the ecommerce website also features an on-site blog that has its own name and brand identity. 

“Between the Sheets” cleverly plays on the products offered on the ecommerce store as well as giving the content on the blog an exclusive feel. 

The imagery and design of the blog create a relaxed and calming vibe thanks to the use of neutral and light blue colors, mirroring the overall website theme of sleep. 

Our Favorite Feature: Almost all of the blog posts focus on a problem a visitor may have, with the solution being one of Au Lit Fine Linens products. This is a clever way of directing blog readers back to the ecommerce section of the website.
